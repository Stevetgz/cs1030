This is a template for a CS web page project.

For this project I wrote an html app where you can convert units like tempture and length
I used html css and js to write this app
It ask the user the units it wants to convert like Celsius to Fahrenhiet ect...
Then it wask to enter a unit value they want to convert
After they click the button in java script it uses an if else statement of what the user selected 
then it uses an equation in each if else that converts the value entered to the  desired result
